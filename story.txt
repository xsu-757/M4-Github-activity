This is a story about the Badger statue standing near the Memorial union. He stands there no matter day or night, winter or summer, with sun or snow, doing nothing.
One day, Badger statue got bored of his life, and decides to take a walk at night.
Unfortunately, he found out that badger is not a creature with night vision just after he opened the door. So he decided to stay unmoved.
